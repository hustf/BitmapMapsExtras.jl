    principal_curvature_and_direction(vκ, lpc) 
    -> (Float64, Float64, Float64)

Compute the principal curvatures κ₁ ≥ κ₂ and the principal direction angle φₚ from three curvature samples.

Given measurements κ(φᵢ) at angles φᵢ (in a common tangent-plane frame), we model

    κ(φ) = κ₁ cos(φ - φₚ)^2 + κ₂ sin(φ - φₚ)^2

where φₚ is the angle (in the same frame) at which the maximum curvature κ₁ occurs.

Expanding via trigonometric identities:
    cos^2(φ - φₚ) = [1 + cos(2φ - 2φₚ)]/2
    sin^2(φ - φₚ) = [1 - cos(2φ - 2φₚ)]/2

leads to the equivalent form

    κ(φ) = a + b cos(2φ) + c sin(2φ)
    where
      a = (κ₁ + κ₂) / 2
      r = (κ₁ - κ₂) / 2  (so b = r cos(2φₚ), c = r sin(2φₚ))

We solve the linear system

    A * [a b c]ᵀ = vκ,

where

    A = [1  cos(2φ₁)  sin(2φ₁);
         1  cos(2φ₂)  sin(2φ₂);
         1  cos(2φ₃)  sin(2φ₃)
         1  cos(2φ₄)  sin(2φ₄)]
      = hcat(ones(Float64, 4), cos.(2vφ), sin.(2vφ))

which we solve with an optimized equivalent to:

    a, b, c = A \\ vκ

Then:
    r = √(b² + c²)
    κ₁ = a + r
    κ₂ = a - r
    φₚ = ½ ⋅ atan2(c, b)

Ensuring φₚ is in the correct branch of [0, 2π).

# Parameters
- vκ    Three curvature samples κ(φᵢ)
- vφ    Three angles φᵢ in the same tangent-plane frame
- lpc   Linear problem reuseable cache

# Returns
- κ₁    Maximum principal curvature
